# AutoBot Navigation Simulation

## Overview

The **AutoBot Navigation Simulation** is a reinforcement learning-based simulation where multiple autobots navigate a grid to reach specified destinations while avoiding obstacles and each other. The system implements the Q-learning algorithm to help the autobots learn optimal paths through interaction with their environment.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Navigation**: Users can create a customizable grid with obstacles, starting points, and goal destinations.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Each autobot learns to navigate through the grid using the Q-learning algorithm, adjusting its strategy based on rewards and penalties.
- **Collision Avoidance**: The simulation includes mechanisms for avoiding collisions between autobots and obstacles.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI allows for easy grid creation and visualization of autobot movements.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `autobot.py` file.
2. ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to the directory containing `autobot.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python autobot.py
